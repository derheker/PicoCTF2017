Use the nc command to connect!
I hear python is a good means (among many) to generate the needed input.
It might help to have multiple windows open

There are a couple ways to solve this.

## The "easy" Way
##### Python:
`import sys`

`print(sys.argv[1]*int(sys.argv[2])+sys.argv[3])`

1. Open a second webshell 
2. Connect to the service via nc
3. Run the Python script with the right parameter (first is the char to print, second the count and the third is the last letter)
4. Copy the output of the script and insert into the webshell with nc running

## the "hard" Way 

Method to automate the process. Dosn't use `nc` to comunicate with the service. Creates it's own [Socket](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berkeley_sockets) to send and receive messages.
We filter with [RegEx](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression) the parameters from the first message we receive.
##### Python

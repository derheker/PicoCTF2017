# Leaf of the Tree

>Leaf of the Tree
We found this annoyingly named directory tree starting at /problems/a45d1519bd193bc3a273744c83fad1e2. It would be pretty lame to type out all of those directory names but maybe there is something in there worth finding? And maybe we dont need to type out all those names...? Follow the trunk, using cat and ls!

>HINTS
Tab completion is a wonderful, wonderful thing

We have no permission to view the contents of `/problems`, this means we have to type cd `cd /problems/57a246295d1345729cbddf98c16fcaed` by handy.
You can also simply copy the absoulute Path and paste it into the Webshell.

After that follow the path of the trunk using [autocompletion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_completion).

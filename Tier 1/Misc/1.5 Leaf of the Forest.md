>We found an even bigger directory tree hiding a flag starting at /problems/57a246295d1345729cbddf98c16fcaed. It would be impossible to find the file named flag manually...


>HINTS
Is there a search function in Linux? Like if I wanted to 'find' something...

[find]() to the flag.

`find /problems/57a246295d1345729cbddf98c16fcaed/ -type f -name flag`

To print its contents use [-exec](). It lets us execute something on each item `{}` found. 

`find /problems/57a246295d1345729cbddf98c16fcaed/ -type f -name flag -exec cat {} \;`

We can chain commands with `-exec` if we pass a new shell as argument. 

`find /problems/57a246295d1345729cbddf98c16fcaed/ -type f -name flag -exec sh -c 'echo $
1; cat $1; echo "\n"' _ {} \; `

`_ {}` tunnels the found item `{}` to `$1`

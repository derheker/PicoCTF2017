>We need to gain access to some routers. Let's try and see if we can find the password in the captured network data: data.pcap.

> HINTS
It looks like someone logged in with their password earlier. Where would log in data be located in a network capture?
If you think you found the flag, but it doesn't work, consider that the data may be encrypted.

[Wireshark](https://www.wireshark.org) is a good program to analyse pcap files.

Most router communicate via HTML and to log-in you need to send a [post](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/POST_(HTTP)).

HTML always encodes packages sent, but wireshark decodes them.

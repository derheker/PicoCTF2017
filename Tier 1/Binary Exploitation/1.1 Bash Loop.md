# Bash Loop
>We found a program that is hiding a flag but requires you to guess the number it is thinking of. Chances are Linux has an easy way to try all the numbers... Go to /problems/995871fcb203d3e223e9e4aaa65e4053 and try it out!


> HINTS
Either use SSH or use the Web Shell to get onto the shell server and navigate to the correct directory. Then do a quick Google search on 'bash loops'. You may need to use grep to filter out the responses as well!


We can wirte a quick loop to guess all numbers between 0 and 4094

# Just No
>A program at /problems/f934d9ca116fb6e3e89cc85baaca028c has access to a flag but refuses to share it. Can you convince it otherwise?


>HINTS
Check out the difference between relative and absolute paths and see if you can figure out how to use them to solve this challenge. Could you possibly spoof another auth file it looks at instead...?

First check out the contents of directio to see that the sourcecode is available. Print it so we can understand the purpose of the program.

The program is using a [relative](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/absolute-relative-pathnames-unix/) path to refer to the auth file.

To exploit that we create the same problem folder somewhere else like this:
`mkdir -p ~/problems/f934d9ca116fb6e3e89cc85baaca028c && cd "$_"`
`$_` hold the parameter of the previous command, such that we can create to directory and the navigate to it in one step

`echo "ImIn" > auth`
to create a auth file
Now start from this workingdirectory justno
`/problems/f934d9ca116fb6e3e89cc85baaca028c/justno`

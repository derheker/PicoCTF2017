# 1.1 Keyz

**Description:**

> While webshells are nice, it'd be nice to be able to login directly. To do so, please add your own public key to ~/.ssh/authorized_keys, using the webshell. Make sure to copy it correctly! The key is in the ssh banner, displayed when you login remotely with ssh, to shell2017.picoctf.com

We need to create a ssh-key:

The -t argument specifies the encryption method. In this case I use RSA

And insert it in ~/.ssh/authorized_keys

The **cat** program prints the contents of a file to stdout, **>** redirects the output to a file. If the file does not exist a new one will be created, if a file with given name already exsists it will be overwritten. To prevent this **>>** can be used, it will append the output to the file.

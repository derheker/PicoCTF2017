We have to accsess a service that's running at shell2017.picoctf on port 9661.
So we scan the port first to see if it is open, to do this we are using [netcat](https://man.openbsd.org/nc.1).
The argument -v enables verbose output, -z prevents netcat from sending data to the service running on that port.

Now we know the port is open. We should be able to communicate with the service running behind it with a tool that can read output form and sent inout to a network.
Telnet, nmap or netcat are suitiable for this job.

After this finish the steps to convert given numbers from one numeral system to an other.
In the first step use an [asciitable](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/dd/ASCII-Table.svg) to convert to letters.
To solve the second task use the table again to the the hex value of thes letter, then transform them to a decimal number. ([this](https://www.permadi.com/tutorial/numHexToDec/) will teach a converting method)

To get get the flag there is one last step, we have to find a string where the sum of the ascii representation from containing chars [modulo](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-science/cryptography/modarithmetic/a/what-is-modular-arithmetic) 16 is equal to a given number x.
Since the ascii-value of A is 65 and 65 %(modulo) 16 = 1, we have to input a string with x times 'A' or the char represented with the ascii-value of 65+x

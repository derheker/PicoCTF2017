# Hex2Raw
>This program requires some unprintable characters as input... But how do you print unprintable characters? CLI yourself to /problems/bee57af2b16368039c96edaa1bd95826 and turn that Hex2Raw!


> HINTS
Google for easy techniques of getting raw output to command line. In this case, you should be looking for an easy solution.

```
dereker@shell-web:/problems/bee57af2b16368039c96edaa1bd95826$ ./hex2raw    
Give me this in raw form (0x41 -> 'A'):
6a5c6fa9602a2d0f439953bcb6f4a611
```

We can decode the string with python and pass it to hex2raw
```bash
python -c "print('6a5c6fa9602a2d0f439953bcb6f4a611'.decode('hex'))" | ./hex2raw
```

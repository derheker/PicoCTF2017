# Raw2Hex
>This program just prints a flag in raw form. All we need to do is convert the output to hex and we have it! CLI yourself to /problems/bdb9a442247cf58a0ebcd5d680e868be and turn that Raw2Hex!


>HINTS
Google is always very helpful in these circumstances. In this case, you should be looking for an easy solution.


The key here is to pipe the output from hex2raw throught [xxd](https://linux.die.net/man/1/xxd).

```
dereker@shell-web:/problems/bdb9a442247cf58a0ebcd5d680e868be$ ./raw2hex | xxd                               
0000000: 5468 6520 666c 6167 2069 733a ff9a 4fdb  The flag is:..O.                                          
0000010: 6995 b557 590a 742b 0e68 5bd3            i..WY.t+.h[.                                              
dereker@shell-web:/problems/bdb9a442247cf58a0ebcd5d680e868be$  
```

"the flag is:" is not a part of the flag, so we count the letters(including whitespace and :). This means that the first 12 hexrepresentations of the ascii char are not part of the flag.
